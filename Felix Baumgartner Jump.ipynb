    "The following notebook was initially designed to be used to teach students how to use code to solve physics problems. It involves a fairly simple problem which is stated as follows, calculate the velocity of Felix Baumgartner's stratospheric jump without ignoring air resistance. This project was the initial motivation for me to start learning how to code and because of that I felt that I should revisit the problem, doing my best to upload pretty much the solutions of the problem without giving away too much. At the sametime I felt that there was one aspect of the problem that could be improved upon. I remembered one of the assumptions taken to be true for this problem was when calculting the force of the drag. The calculation is performed as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "Force_{drag} = \\dfrac{1}{2}\\rho(v_i^2)C_{Drag}A\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $C_{Drag}$ is the drag coefficient of the fluid, in this case it was taken to be dry air. $\\rho$ is the density of air. $A$ is the approximate area of Baumgartner as he fell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now when making the calculation of the acceleration:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "Acceleration = g - \\dfrac{Force_{Drag}}{Mass_{Felix}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $g$ is the acceleration of gravity towards the earth, then by dividing the $Force_{Drag}$ by the mass of Felix we are calculating the acceleration in the opposite direction, then the net acceleration is the difference between the two. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when calculating the force of the drag a large component of the calculation is the associated coefficient of air, which in the model of his sky fall changes but only for three different intervals. Felix's jump starts at 37,000 meters above sea level, and for the height above 36,000 the drag coefficient is 0.18, then above 20,000 it is 0.73, and finally above zero meters it is 0.85. Which I felt could be improved upon to make this calculation even more accurate. \n"

A consequence of this physics question is that it gives the opportunity to see a large difference between making a calculation of velocity with or without air resistance, the calculation of velocity without air resistance is done below.
